# Kedro Palmer Penguins example

> NOTE: Dear reader, this is a beta repo. I.e., if you think there is anything which could be better explained, please create an issue and let me know.
> I'm always happy to take on suggestions. Same goes if this tutorial helped you in any way. :) 

## Overview
This repo was assembled for those who have have tried the [Spaceflights tutorial](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03_tutorial/01_spaceflights_tutorial.html) 
and want to continue practicing using Kedro.  

If you create an empty project using `kedro new` and follow the text by copying and pasting the example code as described,
it will take you approximately **2 hours** and you will end up with a repository as the one in here.  Alternatively, you can clone this repo using 
```python
git clone https://github.com/laisbsc/kedro_penguins.git
```
and tweak the project as you wish, for exploration/adaptation purposes.
 
By working on this example, you will learn how to set up [transformers](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/07_extend_kedro/02_transformers.html?highlight=transformers#dataset-transformers), 
and how to expand your project capabilities by using [Hooks](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/07_extend_kedro/04_hooks.html?highlight=hooks) with the [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io) Python library for the [Penguins dataset](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins).

## About the Dataset

The Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) Penguins dataset was made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station Antartica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTRN)](https://lternet.edu).

The `palmerpenguins` package contains two pandas datasets, `size_penguins.csv` and `penguins_iter.csv`.
The former is hosted on an AWS Cloud, on a S3 bucket. The latter is locally hosted under `data/01_raw`.

## The datasets
### Variables:
`size_penguins.csv`
- species: penguin species (Chinstrap, AdÃ©lie, or Gentoo)
- culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
- culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
- flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
- body_mass_g: body mass (g)
- island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)
- sex: penguin gender  
** `penguins_iter.csv`: Original `size_penguins.csv` combined with data for 3 penguin species.

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

Thank you everyone for gathering this info and for making it widely available. Special thanks to Dr. Gorman, Palmer Station LTER and the LTER Network and to Marty Downs.

*What are culmen length & depth?*
The culmen is "the upper ridge of a bird's beak" (definition from Oxford Languages).

For this penguin data, the `culmen length` and `culmen depth` are measured as shown below (thanks Kristen Gorman for clarifying!):

## The Project - Advanced Kedro tutorial

### Aim

This repository uses the `size_penguins.csv` dataset, hosted on AWS cloud env and the `iter_penguins.csv`, hosted locally.
The aim of this example is to show users how to:
 - Load 'remote' data, in this case, a `.csv` file hosted in a AWS S3 bucket.
 - Generate a scatter plot with the data in the catalog with `kedro run`.
 - Convert the plot ('scatter_plot.png') in a node using Transcode.
 - Use Kedro Hooks to expand the project with the Great Expectations plugin.  
   > Note: the last part of the project will use PySpark, which requires Java to be installed. To install Java (macOS) type `brew cask install java` on your terminal.  
                                                                                  >[It did not work for me - troubleshoot?]

## Rules and guidelines for best practice

To get the best out of this template:
 * Please don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
 * Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a data engineering convention, e.g. the one we suggest [here](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/06_resources/01_faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
 * Don't commit any data to your repository
 * Don't commit any credentials or local configuration to your repository
 * Keep all credentials or local configuration in `conf/local/`
