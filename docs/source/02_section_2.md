## About the Dataset

The Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) Penguins dataset was made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station Antartica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTRN)](https://lternet.edu).

The `palmerpenguins` package contains two pandas datasets, `size_penguins.csv` and `penguins_iter.csv`.
The former is hosted on an AWS Cloud, on a S3 bucket. The latter is locally hosted under `data/01_raw`.

*What are culmen length & depth?*
The culmen is "the upper ridge of a bird's beak" (definition from Oxford Languages).

For this penguin data, the `culmen length` and `culmen depth` are measured as shown below (thanks Kristen Gorman for clarifying!):
